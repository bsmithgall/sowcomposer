Any comments/instructions about the template can go up here, before the divider below. They will NOT be parsed nor saved as part of the public system.

Note: you only have to define all parts of a variable once. For example, once you write {{ AGENCY | Agency | The agency that you work for. }}, the next time you can just write {{AGENCY}} and it will inherit the name and help text.
